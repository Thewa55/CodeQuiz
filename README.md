# CodeQuiz

Hello welcome to my quiz. I coded this purely out of Javascript (with the help of bootstrap for making it look prettier). You start the quiz by pressing on start quiz. Once the button is pressed the first question is presented to the user, the user is given 70 seconds to finish the quiz.

There are a total of 10 questions, every question that you get wrong will take 7 seconds off the clock. Once the quiz is done you can input your name, and taken to the scoring table. The scoring table have all your previous scores (if you have played before, otherwise it will be empty). On that page you can choose to clear the scores or play again! Have fun and enjoy it.

You can view the scores at any time now!
